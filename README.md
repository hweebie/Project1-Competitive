# Hyper Bishi Bashwee

A two-player arcade game where you and your friend can play a series of competitive minigames against each other. 
Inspired by Hyper Bishi Bashi, a 90s arcade game. 

This game was developed as part of my coursework for my Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp in General Assembly and features original pixel art.
